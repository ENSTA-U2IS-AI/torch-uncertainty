_TorchUncertainty_ is a package designed to help you leverage uncertainty quantification techniques and make your deep neural networks more reliable. It aims at being collaborative and including as many methods as possible, so reach out to add yours!

:construction: _TorchUncertainty_ is in early development :construction: - expect changes, but reach out and contribute if you are interested in the project! **Please raise an issue if you have any bugs or difficulties and join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/HMCawt5MJu).**

---

This package provides a multi-level API, including:

- ready-to-train baselines on research datasets, such as ImageNet and CIFAR
- deep learning baselines available for training on your datasets
- [pretrained weights](https://huggingface.co/torch-uncertainty) for these baselines on ImageNet and CIFAR (work in progress ðŸš§).
- layers available for use in your networks
- scikit-learn style post-processing methods such as Temperature Scaling

See the [Reference page](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/references.html) or the [API reference](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/api.html) for a more exhaustive list of the implemented methods, datasets, metrics, etc.
