Torch Uncertainty
=================

A PyTorch Library for benchmarking and leveraging efficient predictive
uncertainty quantification techniques. 

Torch Uncertainty is a package designed to help you leverage uncertainty
quantification techniques and make your neural networks more reliable. It is
based on PyTorch Lightning to handle multi-GPU training and inference and
automatic logging through tensorboard.
