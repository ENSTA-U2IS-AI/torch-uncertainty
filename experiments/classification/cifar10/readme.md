# CIFAR10 - Benchmark

This folder contains the code to train models on the CIFAR10 dataset. The task is to classify images into $10$ classes.

## ResNet-backbone models

`torch-uncertainty` leverages [LightningCLI](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.cli.LightningCLI.html#lightning.pytorch.cli.LightningCLI) the configurable command line tool for pytorch-lightning. To ease the train of models, we provide a set of predefined configurations for the CIFAR10 dataset. The configurations are located in the `configs` folder.

**Train**

```bash
```

**Evaluate**

```bash
```
