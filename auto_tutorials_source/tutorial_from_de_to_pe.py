"""Improved Ensemble parameter-efficiency with Packed-Ensembles
============================================================

*This tutorial is adapted from a notebook part of a lecture given at the [Helmholtz AI Conference](https://haicon24.de/) by Sebastian Starke, Peter Steinbach, Gianni Franchi, and Olivier Laurent.*

In this notebook will work on the MNIST dataset that was introduced by Corinna Cortes, Christopher J.C. Burges, and later modified by Yann LeCun in the foundational paper:

- [Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." Proceedings of the IEEE.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf)

The MNIST dataset consists of 70 000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The images are grayscale and 28x28-pixel sized. The task is to classify the images into their respective digits. The dataset can be automatically downloaded using the `torchvision` library.

In this notebook, we will train a model and an ensemble on this task and evaluate their performance. The performance will consist in the following metrics:
- Accuracy: the proportion of correctly classified images,
- Brier score: a measure of the quality of the predicted probabilities,
- Calibration error: a measure of the calibration of the predicted probabilities,
- Negative Log-Likelihood: the value of the loss on the test set.

Throughout this notebook, we abstract the training and evaluation process using [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/)
and [TorchUncertainty](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/).

Similarly to keras for tensorflow, PyTorch Lightning is a high-level interface for PyTorch that simplifies the training and evaluation process using a Trainer.
TorchUncertainty is partly built on top of PyTorch Lightning and provides tools to train and evaluate models with uncertainty quantification.

TorchUncertainty includes datamodules that handle the data loading and preprocessing. We don't use them here for tutorial purposes.

# 1. Download, instantiate and visualize the datasets
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The dataset is automatically downloaded using torchvision. We then visualize a few images to see a bit what we are working with.

# Create the transforms for the images
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as T

# We set the number of epochs to some low value for the sake of time
max_epochs = 2

train_transform = T.Compose(
    [
        T.ToTensor(),
        # We perform random cropping as data augmentation
        T.RandomCrop(28, padding=4),
        # As for the MNIST1d dataset, we normalize the data
        T.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,)),
    ]
)
test_transform = T.Compose(
    [
        T.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1),
        T.ToTensor(),
        T.CenterCrop(28),
        T.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,)),

# %%
# You could replace all this cell by simply loading the MNIST datamodule from TorchUncertainty.
# Now, let's visualize a few images from the dataset. For this task, we use the viz_data dataset that applies no transformation to the images.

# Datasets without transformation to visualize the unchanged data

# 3. Training an ensemble of models with TorchUncertainty
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# You have two options here, you can either train the ensemble directly if you have enough memory,
# otherwise, you can train independent models and do the ensembling during the evaluation (sometimes called inference).
#
# In this case, we will do it sequentially. In this tutorial, you have the choice between training multiple models,
# which will take time if you have no GPU, or downloading the pre-trained models that we have prepared for you.
#
# Training the ensemble
#
# To train the ensemble, you will have to use the "deep_ensembles" function from TorchUncertainty, which will
# replicate and change the initialization of your networks to ensure diversity.

# Create the ensemble model

    task="classification",
    reset_model_parameters=True,
)

ens_routine = ClassificationRoutine(
    is_ensemble=True,
    num_classes=10,
    model=ensemble,
    loss=nn.CrossEntropyLoss(),  # The loss for the training
    format_batch_fn=RepeatTarget(
        2
    ),  # How to handle the targets when comparing the predictions
    optim_recipe=optim_recipe(
        ensemble, 2.0
    ),  # The optimization scheme with the optimizer and the scheduler as a dictionnary
    eval_ood=True,  # We want to evaluate the OOD-related metrics
)
trainer.fit(ens_routine, train_dataloaders=train_dl, val_dataloaders=test_dl)
ens_perf = trainer.test(ens_routine, dataloaders=[test_dl, ood_dl])

# %%
# The results are not comparable since we only trained the ensemble for one epoch to reduce GitHub's cpu usage.
# Feel free to run the notebook on your machine for a longer duration.
#
# We need to multiply the learning rate by 2 to account for the fact that we have 4 models
# in the ensemble and that we average the loss over all the predictions.
#
# #### Downloading the pre-trained models
#
# We have put the pre-trained models on Hugging Face that you can download with the utility function
# "hf_hub_download" imported just below. These models are trained for 75 epochs and are therefore not
# comparable to the all the other models trained in this notebook. The pretrained models can be seen
# [here](https://huggingface.co/ENSTA-U2IS/tutorial-models) and TorchUncertainty's are [here](https://huggingface.co/torch-uncertainty).

# 4. From Deep Ensembles to Packed-Ensembles
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# In the paper [Packed-Ensembles for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09184)
# published at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in 2023, we introduced a
# modification of Deep Ensembles to make it more computationally-efficient. The idea is to pack the ensemble
# members into a single model, which allows us to train the ensemble in a single forward pass.
# This modification is particularly useful when the ensemble size is large, as it is often the case in practice.
#
# We will need to update the model and replace the layers with their Packed equivalents. You can find the
# documentation of the Packed-Linear layer [here](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/generated/torch_uncertainty.layers.PackedLinear.html),
# and the Packed-Conv2D, [here](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/generated/torch_uncertainty.layers.PackedLinear.html).

#
# To Go Further & More Concepts of Uncertainty in ML
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# **Question 1:** Have a look at the models in the "lightning_logs". If you are on your own machine, try to visualize the learning curves with `tensorboard --logdir lightning_logs`.
#
# **Question 2:** Add a cell below and try to find the errors made by packed-ensembles on the test set. Visualize the errors and their labels and look at the predictions of the different sub-models. Are they similar? Can you think of uncertainty scores that could help you identify these errors?
#
# Selective Classification
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Selective classification or "prediction with rejection" is a paradigm in uncertainty-aware machine learning where the model can decide not to make a prediction if the confidence score given by the model is below some pre-computed threshold. This can be useful in real-world applications where the cost of making a wrong prediction is high.
#
# In constrast to calibration, the values of the confidence scores are not important, only the order of the scores. *Ideally, the best model will order all the correct predictions first, and all the incorrect predictions last.* In this case, there will be a threshold so that all the predictions above the threshold are correct, and all the predictions below the threshold are incorrect.
#
# In TorchUncertainty, we look at 3 different metrics for selective classification:
# - **AURC**: The area under the Risk (% of errors) vs. Coverage (% of classified samples) curve. This curve expresses how the risk of the model evolves as we increase the coverage (the proportion of predictions that are above the selection threshold). This metric will be minimized by a model able to perfectly separate the correct and incorrect predictions.
#
# The following metrics are computed at a fixed risk and coverage level and that have practical interests. The idea of these metrics is that you can set the selection threshold to achieve a certain level of risk and coverage, as required by the technical constraints of your application:
# - **Coverage at 5% Risk**: The proportion of predictions that are above the selection threshold when it is set for the risk to egal 5%. Set the risk threshold to your application constraints. The higher the better.
# - **Risk at 80% Coverage**: The proportion of errors when the coverage is set to 80%. Set the coverage threshold to your application constraints. The lower the better.
#
# Grouping Loss
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The grouping loss is a measure of uncertainty orthogonal to calibration. Have a look at [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16315) to learn about it. Check out their small library [GLest](https://github.com/aperezlebel/glest). TorchUncertainty includes a wrapper of the library to compute the grouping loss with eval_grouping_loss parameter.
